# Privacy Policy

Lisyn (the “App”), which is owned and developed by Alexander Tokarev, does not collect any personally identifiable information about any users who install the app.
The App requires access to the Bluetooth module of the device in order to connect it to other devices to sync the musical playlist and information about votes for the songs. The App also requires access to music & media of the user in order to search and play songs from the Apple Music library.
